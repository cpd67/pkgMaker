1). Creating Debian packages.
	* As an Ubuntu user, I should be able to make Debian packages.
2). Creating RPM packages.
	* As a RedHat user, I should be able to make RPM packages.
3). Adding a new distro. (Which lib?) (Ubuntu only)
	* As an Ubuntu user, I want to make new packages for new distros.
4). Adding a new library (WORST-CASE; If a new dependency is added to TSGL and a package is needed).
	* As a user, I want to add a new library to TSGL.
5). Remaking one package vs. Remaking ALL packages.
	* One package: As a user, I should be able to remake one package.
	* ALL packages: As a user, I should be able to remake ALL packages.
6). First time setup.
	* As a user, setting up should be as painless as possible. 

./pkgMaker (Could be first time setup OR Debian packages).
./pkgMaker --add-distro <distro-name> 
./pkgMaker --rpm 
./pkgMaker --single <lib-name>
./pkgMaker --all 
./pkgMaker --remake (Default is remake all Debian packages)
./pkgMaker --remake --single <lib-name>
./pkgMaker --remake --rpm
./pkgMaker --remake --rpm --single <lib-name>
