TO-DO pkgMaker
---------------

* Still have to do error-handling for the infoGetter.

* Still have to do error-handling overall.
	+ What happens when the user decides to run the pkgMaker.sh script somewhere else (nowhere near the helpers folder)?
	+ What happens when the user mucks up the directories and scatters them all around?
	+ What happens when a file does not exist?

* Still have to add the two loops for scripts. (lib -> distro).
	+ Scripts to do it for:
		- versChecker.sh (COMPLETE)
		- dirMaker.sh (COMPLETE)
		- copyer.sh (three; lib -> distro -> $lib-$newVersNum) (COMPLETE).
		- debHandler.sh (COMPLETE).
	+ The distro loop in dirMaker.sh will create the distro specific directories (lib/distroName).
		- Those contain the package directories.
		- You will have to update the paths in each file that goes into ~/pkgMaker/packages.
	
* Still have to make a cleanup script that deletes all of the old text files.
	+ It will delete masterDir.txt after completion.

* Still need current version number files for each library.
	* TSGL, GLFW

* Still have to make docs explaining where things should go.
	* Users *MUST* have the library source code files in a directory inside of a 'workspace' directory.
	* The library directory name *MUST* match the name in the libs.txt file.

* Still have to make debian file templates 
	* debianFiles/ , changelog, control, copyright, ...
	* Figure out a way to "futureproof" the creation of those things. (In the event that a new dependency is added to TSGL and a new library package has to be made.)
 	* SOLVED: Create default templates for the "necessary" files:
		+ changelog
		+ control
		+ copyright
		+ compat
		+ rules
		+ source/format
		+ preinst, postinst
		+ OR...Just copy over the debian folder to the tsgl and GLFW new distro folder and have the user edit them. 
		+ Tell user to use dch -i to edit the changelog file after they are finished!

* Things to keep in mind:
	+ Distro-specific version updates (if the user updates the code that takes advantage of something that Xenial has and Trusty doesn't, for example).
	+ Any change made to the source code must be reflected in the packages for ALL distros (except in the case above).
	+ If you only have to change stuff inside of the debian folder, you DO NOT need pkgManager. You simply have to make your changes, update the deb number,
	  and re-upload.

--------------------------
| Possible optimizations |
--------------------------

* Replace loops with recursion.
* Use functions instead of files.

------------------
| Finished items |
------------------

* Added a check for the version number.
	+ When it is 1.0 and the user makes a bug fix, 1.0 -> 1.0.1.
	+ FIXED. 
	+ I checked in the infoGetter.sh and versChecker.sh scripts using regular expressions.

* Changed naming from "*FirstTime.txt" to "*FirstUse.txt" (and references to it in versChecker.sh).

* Modified dirMaker.sh.
	+ What happens when the user just runs the pkgMaker.sh script without having the tsgl and glfw folders made? (Clean workspace problem).
		- That will mess up the version getting stage and directory maker stage. 
		- The old version number will be the new version number at that point.
		- I could have a $libOldVersion.txt file, which contains the old version number.
		- That could be in a special directory that the version getter checks...
		- if oldVersion.txt exists, then we must not have a clean workspace. The directory MUST exist.
			* Have a check that makes sure (and scolds the user if they don't have it).
			* If the user put the oldVersion.txt file while having a clean workspace, 
			  the check will catch that, clean up (remove the oldVersion.txt file), and scold the user.
		- dirMaker.sh will check imp/ to see if packages have been made. versChecker.sh will put a file that tells dirMaker.sh whether or not that is the case.
	+ FIXED.

+ Uploaded the packages/ directory to GitHub. I guess GitHub will ignore empty directories...

* Added the two loops for scripts. (lib -> distro).
	+ Scripts to do it for:
		- versChecker.sh (COMPLETE)
		- dirMaker.sh (COMPLETE)
		- copyer.sh (three; lib -> distro -> $lib-$newVersNum) (COMPLETE).
		- debHandler.sh (COMPLETE).
	+ The distro loop in dirMaker.sh will create the distro specific directories (lib/distroName).
		- Those contain the package directories.
		- You will have to update the paths in each file that goes into ~/pkgMaker/packages.
