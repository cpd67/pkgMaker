TO-DO pkgMaker
---------------

* Still have to do error-handling for the infoGetter.
 
* Still have to do copyer.sh and debHandler.sh scripts.

* Still have to do error-handling overall.
	+ What happens when the user decides to run the pkgMaker.sh script somewhere else (nowhere near the helpers folder)?
	+ What happens when the user mucks up the directories and scatters them all around?
	+ What happens when a file does not exist?

* Still have to add the two loops for scripts. (lib -> distro).
	+ Three for copyer.sh. (lib -> distro -> $lib-$newVersNum).

* Still have to make a cleanup script that deletes all of the old text files.

* Things to keep in mind:
	+ Distro-specific version updates (if the user updates the code that takes advantage of something that Xenial has and Trusty doesn't, for example).
	+ Any change made to the source code must be reflected in the packages for ALL distros (except in the case above).
	+ If you only have to change stuff inside of the debian folder, you DO NOT need pkgManager. You simply have to make your changes, update the deb number,
	  and re-upload.

------------------

* Added a check for the version number.
	+ When it is 1.0 and the user makes a bug fix, 1.0 -> 1.0.1.
	+ FIXED. 
	+ I checked in the infoGetter.sh and versChecker.sh scripts using regular expressions.

* Changed naming from "*FirstTime.txt" to "*FirstUse.txt" (and references to it in versChecker.sh).

* Modified dirMaker.sh.
	+ What happens when the user just runs the pkgMaker.sh script without having the tsgl and glfw folders made? (Clean workspace problem).
		- That will mess up the version getting stage and directory maker stage. 
		- The old version number will be the new version number at that point.
		- I could have a $libOldVersion.txt file, which contains the old version number.
		- That could be in a special directory that the version getter checks...
		- if oldVersion.txt exists, then we must not have a clean workspace. The directory MUST exist.
			* Have a check that makes sure (and scolds the user if they don't have it).
			* If the user put the oldVersion.txt file while having a clean workspace, 
			  the check will catch that, clean up (remove the oldVersion.txt file), and scold the user.
		- dirMaker.sh will check imp/ to see if packages have been made. versChecker.sh will put a file that tells dirMaker.sh whether or not that is the case.
	+ FIXED.
